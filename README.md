# CS360

The purpose of this project was to demostrate the skills to develop and build a functioning inventory tracking app. The requirements of the project
stated that there were to be at least 3 screens, a log-in, inventory, and setting screen. I added a fourth screen as it made the app more intuitive
when adding a new item. The log-in screen needed an edit text box to type a username and a second edit text box for the password that need to 
obscure the letters as they are being typed. Included on the screen there are two buttons, one to create a new account and another to log in. The 
invetory screen needed to utilize a grid view to display the items in the inventory. Each item needed to include the name of the item, quanitity, 
and three buttons. One of the buttons added to the quanitity and another decreased the quanitity while the third deleted the entry. The settings 
screen needed to allow the user to enable notifications. The fourth screen had edit boxes to type the name of the item and the quanitity along with
a button to save the entry.

I approached this project by exploring and experimenting with a seperate development application. This allowed me to learn in an environment that 
avoiding issues in the later portions of development. I also practiced an iterative cycle where I would develop a small section of code, test the 
code to see if it was working as intended and if I needed to make any changes to the code. Outside of the smaller cycles I also focused my attention
to one feature to be implemented at a time. This iterative process will serve me well in the work place by getting familiar with the processes needed
in the workplace.

I tested the product by going through adding a new account, logging in, creating new items. I would also close the app, restart the phone in the
emulator and logging back in to ensure that the database saved the state of the database.
